Research Questions:

1. The reason for this is that since the compiler detects that we are throwing NullPointerException which is unchecked. It doesn't
need to check the exception again so when it is caught as a throwable the compiler continues to ignore the exception along with
declaration type.

2. You are able to call the default implementation of a method in an interface with some weird syntax because in java 9 default
